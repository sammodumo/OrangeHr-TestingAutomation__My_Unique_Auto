This project demonstrates automated testing of an Employee Management System using Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver. The tests simulate common user actions such as adding, searching, editing, and deleting employee records on the OrangeHRM platform.

Features:
Cucumber Integration: Utilizes Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) to write test scenarios in Gherkin format.
Selenium WebDriver: Automates web interactions to simulate user actions.
Page Object Model (POM): Implements POM design pattern for better code organization and maintenance.
ExtentReports Integration: Generates detailed HTML reports using ExtentReports to track test execution and results.
Key Scenarios Covered:
Add Employee: Simulates adding a new employee to the system.
Search Employee: Searches for an existing employee by name and verifies their details.
Edit Employee: Updates employee details such as license number after searching by ID.
Delete Employee: Deletes an employee record after searching by ID.
Technologies Used:
Java: Programming language for writing test automation code.
Cucumber: BDD framework for writing feature files and step definitions.
Selenium WebDriver: Automation tool for web browser interactions.
ExtentReports: Reporting library to generate detailed HTML reports.
